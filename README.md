# Insured trading platform

*This project is a Java-Angular fullstack developer portfolio.*

## Description

It is built for scalability, security, and clean modular architecture using the latest technologies:

- **Backend**: Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.5, with Spring Security and JWT for robust authentication and authorization. Usage of Spring Test for services and dtos unit testing (launched at application start).

- **Frontend**: Responsive Angular using signals and resources and keeping components fully independent and driven by services. Usage of Angular Material for theming. Usage of karma for unit testing services with `npm run test` command launched from its docker container.

- **UI**: Angular Material for a clean, accessible, and responsive design supporting light/dark mode from user preferences.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL, with JPA for data access.

As this is not meant to be an entreprise-level application, it focuses on development skills, not on actual business logic, trading features or deployment.

It has a monolithic architecture, to avoid micro-services infrastructure complexity.

It uses enum types to aggregate models that would otherwise each require their own model (e.g. BankingAccount and TradingAccount models instead of, in this application's case, Account model with "Banking" or "Trading" enum type field).
